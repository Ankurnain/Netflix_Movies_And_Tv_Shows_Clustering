Problem Statement :

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.
In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.
Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

About the Data :
We have the data of which contains details of customers like id , age, gender and also contains the details of the customers vehicle

Dataset info

Number of records: 7787
2.Number of features: 12


Objectives:
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis.
Try understanding what type content is available in different countries.
Check if Netflix is increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.
Clustering similar content by matching text-based features.
Methods used:
Descriptive Statistics.
Data Visualization.
Machine Learning.
Libraries utilized:
NumPy and Pandas - For dataset cleaning and analysis.
Matplotlib, Plotly and Seaborn - For Data Visualization.
SkLearn and nltk - For machine learning and clustering.

Features information:
The dataset contains features like:

show_id : Unique ID for every Movie / Tv Show
type : A Movie or TV Show
title : Title of the Movie / Tv Shows
director : Director of the Movie
cast : Actors involved in the movie / show
country : Country where the movie / show was produced
date_added : Date it was added on Netflix
release_year : Actual Release year of the movie / show
rating : TV Rating of the movie / show
duration : Total Duration - in minutes or number of seasons
listed_in : Generes

Conclusion:
Director and cast contains a large number of null values so we will drop these 2 columns .
In this dataset there are two types of contents where 30.86% includes TV shows and the remaining 69.14% carries Movies.
We have reached a conclusion from our analysis from the content added over years that Netflix is focusing movies and TV shows (Fom 2016 data we get to know that Movies is increased by 80% and TV shows is increased by 73% compare)
From the dataset insights we can conclude that the most number of TV Shows released in 2017 and for Movies it is 2020
On Netflix USA has the largest number of contents. And most of the countries preferred to produce movies more than TV shows.
Most of the movies are belonging to 3 categories
TOP 3 content categories are International movies , dramas , comedies.
In text analysis (NLP) I used stop words, removed punctuations , stemming & TF-IDF vectorizer and other functions of NLP.
Applied different clustering models like Kmeans, hierarchical, Agglomerative clustering, DBSCAN on data we got the best cluster arrangements.
By applying different clustering algorithms to our dataset .we get the optimal number of cluster is equal to 3
